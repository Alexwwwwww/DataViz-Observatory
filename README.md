# DataViz-Observatory
This project was from a graduate school-level course (IS445) I took in my exchange study at University of Illinois Urbana Champaign.
## Dataset
Climate Change in the Contiguous United States
- The Washington Post's series, "2ÂºC: Beyond the Limit."
- Monthly temperature data between 1895 and 2019 for the mainland 48 states.
## Initial Ideas
- Average Temperature Comparison Between National and Illinois
- Temperatures by State per Year
- Temperatures by County for 2019
- Temperature in Illinois by County for 2019
- Comparison between max & min temp(by state)
- Temperature in Illinois by County (2010-2019)
## Observatory (Part III)
- Temperatures through the years (can view temperature from throughout the year by adjusting the slide bar)
- State and County maps (can hop the mouse and see more information)
- Line graph trends (can look up for the visualizations in different time period throughout the year by adjusting thre slide bar)
- Issues: Plotly with Colab, Variable dropdowns, Runtime
